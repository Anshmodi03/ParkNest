## 🚀 Getting Started

### Prerequisites

Make sure you have the following installed:

- [Node.js](https://nodejs.org/) (v14 or later)
- [Git](https://git-scm.com/)
- [MongoDB](https://www.mongodb.com/) (either local installation or MongoDB Atlas for cloud hosting)
- [npm](https://www.npmjs.com/) or [yarn](https://yarnpkg.com/) (for managing dependencies)

### Installation

1. **Clone the Repository**:

   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/Anshmodi03/ParkNest.git
   cd ParkNest
   ```

### 2. Install Dependencies

For both the frontend and backend, you need to install the required dependencies.

- **Frontend**:

  1. Navigate to the client directory:
     ```bash
     cd client
     ```
  2. Install the frontend dependencies:
     ```bash
     npm install
     ```

- **Backend**:
  1. Navigate to the server directory:
     ```bash
     cd server
     ```
  2. Install the backend dependencies:
     ```bash
     npm install
     ```

After running the above commands, all required dependencies for both the frontend and backend will be installed.

3. **Set Up Environment Variables**:  
   Create a `.env` file in the root directory inside the server directory and add the required configuration variables:

   ```
   MONGO_URI=<your-databasei-url>
   ```

   ```
   PORT=<your-port-number>
   ```

   ```
   JWT_SECRET=<your-JWT-secret key>
   ```

### 4. Run the Application

- **Frontend**:

  1. Navigate to the `client` directory:
     ```bash
     cd client
     ```
  2. Start the frontend application:
     ```bash
     npm start
     ```

- **Backend**:

     ```bash
     cd server
     ```

Once both applications are running, open your browser and go to `http://localhost:3000` to view the frontend, and the backend should be running on `http://localhost:8000` (or the specified port).
